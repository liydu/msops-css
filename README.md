# msops-css
Use Sass-like markup in CSS, based on PostCSS with only up to date and essential plugins. Inspired by [Precss](https://jonathantneal.github.io/precss/).

## Initialtive

Precss is a nice collection of [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss) plugins. But some of the features it provides are rarely used (extend, atroot, custom-properties...) and I do miss other features like calc and on.

## Plugins

PreCSS blends Sass-like strength with W3C future-syntax superpower, powered by the following plugins (in this order):

- [postcss-import]: Transform `@import` rules by inling content
- [postcss-mixins]: Sass-like mixins
- [postcss-advanced-variables]: Sass-like variables and methods
- [postcss-calc]: Reduce calc()
- [postcss-custom-media]: W3C custom media queries
- [postcss-media-minmax]: W3C `<` `<=` `>=` `>` media queries
- [postcss-color-function]: W3C color methods
- [postcss-nesting]: W3C nested selectors
- [postcss-nested]: Sass-like nested selectors
- [postcss-property-lookup]: reference other property values
- [postcss-selector-matches]: W3C multiple matches pseudo-classes
- [postcss-selector-not]: W3C multiple not pseudo-classes
